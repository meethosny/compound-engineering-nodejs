# Troubleshooting: [Clear Problem Title]

## Problem
[1-2 sentence clear description of the issue and what the user experienced]

## Environment
- Module: [Name or "SYSTEM"]
- Node.js Version: [e.g., 20.10.0]
- Affected Component: [e.g., "User Service", "Auth Middleware", "Payment Route"]
- Date: [YYYY-MM-DD when this was solved]

## Symptoms
- [Observable symptom 1 - what the user saw/experienced]
- [Observable symptom 2 - error messages, visual issues, unexpected behavior]
- [Continue as needed - be specific]

## What Didn't Work

**Attempted Solution 1:** [Description of what was tried]
- **Why it failed:** [Technical reason this didn't solve the problem]

**Attempted Solution 2:** [Description of second attempt]
- **Why it failed:** [Technical reason]

[Continue for all significant attempts that DIDN'T work]

[If nothing else was attempted first, write:]
**Direct solution:** The problem was identified and fixed on the first attempt.

## Solution

[The actual fix that worked - provide specific details]

**Code changes** (if applicable):
```javascript
// Before (broken):
[Show the problematic code]

// After (fixed):
[Show the corrected code with explanation]
```

**Database migration** (if applicable):
```javascript
// Migration change:
[Show what was changed in the migration]
```

**Commands run** (if applicable):
```bash
# Steps taken to fix:
[Commands or actions]
```

## Why This Works

[Technical explanation of:]
1. What was the ROOT CAUSE of the problem?
2. Why does the solution address this root cause?
3. What was the underlying issue (API misuse, configuration error, async timing issue, etc.)?

[Be detailed enough that future developers understand the "why", not just the "what"]
